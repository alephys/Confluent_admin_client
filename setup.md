How to Run This Application
Prerequisites:

Python 3.6+

pip for installing packages

Access to an LDAP server for authentication.

Confluent Platform installed locally or on a server, with the confluent-admin-client command-line tool available in your system's PATH.

Installation:

Create a project directory and save the Python code as app.py.

Create a templates folder inside your project directory and save all the HTML files there.

Install the required Python libraries:

pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Login ldap3

Configuration:

app.py: Open app.py and modify the configuration variables at the top of the file:

LDAP_SERVER: The hostname or IP address of your LDAP server.

LDAP_ADMIN_GROUP: The full Distinguished Name (DN) of the group for admin users.

CONFLUENT_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS: Your Kafka broker address.

You will also need to adjust the user_dn and search base formats in the authenticate_ldap function to match your specific LDAP schema.

client.properties: Create a file named client.properties in the same directory as app.py. This file should contain the necessary connection details for your Confluent cluster, especially if you are using SASL or SSL.
Example client.properties for SASL_SSL:

bootstrap.servers=pkc-xxxx.us-east-2.aws.confluent.cloud:9092
security.protocol=SASL_SSL
sasl.mechanisms=PLAIN
sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="YOUR_API_KEY" password="YOUR_API_SECRET";

Running the Application:

From your terminal, in the project directory, run the Flask application:

python app.py

Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5001.

Core Components Explained
Flask Web Framework: A lightweight framework used to build the web interface, handle routing, and manage user sessions.

LDAP3 for Authentication: This library connects to your LDAP server to verify user credentials and check for membership in the admin group, determining their role within the application.

SQLAlchemy and SQLite: We use SQLAlchemy as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to interact with a simple SQLite database file (kafka_requests.db). This database stores all user requests, their status, and execution history. It's lightweight and requires no separate database server.

Flask-Login: Manages the user session lifecycle (logging in, logging out, remembering users).

Confluent-Admin-Client Integration: The application securely calls the official confluent-admin-client tool using Python's subprocess module. This is a robust way to apply changes to your Kafka cluster, ensuring you're using the standard Confluent tooling. All output from these commands is captured and stored as logs.

Jinja2 Templating (HTML files): This allows us to dynamically generate HTML pages. The user interface is separated into distinct pages for login, the user dashboard, the admin dashboard, and detailed request views.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for creating a modern, clean, and responsive user interface without writing custom CSS.

This setup provides a solid foundation. You can expand it by adding more request types, more detailed forms, or by integrating it with other internal tools. Let me know if you have any questions or would like to explore modifications!
